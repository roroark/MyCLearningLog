My C Learning Log<br>
This repository contains the things I did when learning C.

I have worked on the following micro projects:<br>
1. Next Permutation of a string: source/nextp.c<br>
2. An executable "sysc" that executes its command-line arguments: source/sysc.c<br>
3. Modify "sysc" to "timex" to time the execution (using clock_t clock()): source/timex.c<br>
4. Modify "timex" to "avtex" to time the execution n times, specified by the argument immediately after the -n flag [10 default] : source/avtex.c<br>
5. Implement C's time seeded pseudo random number generator that accepts an optional command line argument to generate n random numbers: source/rand.c<br>
<!-- Variadic and Callback Functions [Under Construction]
4. Timing various sorts on Random Input [Scheduled]
5. Multithreaded Merge Sort [Scheduled]
6. Google Search API [Scheduled] -->
