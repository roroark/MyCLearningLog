My C Learning Log<br>
This repository contains the things I did when learning C.

I have worked on the following micro projects:<br>
1. Next Permutation of a string: source/nextp.c<br>
2. An executable "sysc" that executes its command-line arguments: source/sysc.c<br>
3. Modify "sysc" to "tsys" to time the execution. Remaining functionality remaining the same.<br>
